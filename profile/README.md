Target Package is a subsidiary of [Meese Enterprises](https://github.com/meese-enterprises), and is developed by a team of seasoned cybersecurity professionals. Our goal is to provide a simple, easy-to-use, and effective tool for researchers to use in their day-to-day operations. We are firm believers in the power of Open Source Software (OSS), and we strive to do our part in hopes to 'pass it on.'

## Why us?

Having used dozens of open-source and commercial tools, we found that there was often a need to go through a number of different tools to complete an investigation. We decided to create Target Package to help remedy this burden. We wanted to create a tool that would allow anyone in the cybersecurity industry to carry out their mission from a single unified interface, and we have been working to accomplish just that.
